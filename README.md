Kata Hotel World Clocks
=======================

Use Robot Framework Maven Plugin and Java to implement the Hotel World Clocks kata and refactor it to Observer design pattern. In this kata, a hotel has 5 clocks showing the time of Beijing (UTC+8), London (UTC+0), Moscow (UTC+4), Sydney (UTC+10), and New York (UTC-5). You have to consider daylight saving time for cities like London and New York in this kata. When the time of each one of these clocks is set due to wrong time or start/end of daylight saving period, the time of all other clocks will be set automatically. The hotel would add more clocks for different cities in the future.
